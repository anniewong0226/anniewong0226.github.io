        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                This is a graph from the Financial Times with a poorly represented scale. I accessed the original graph and suspect that they have used the log scale but used the unaltered value as the scale. 
                For example, the US did have around $60000 in 2020 as GDP per head, but on log scale, it's more like 11. I used the same data source from the Maddison Project, but an older version ( because i couldnt download the 2023 version somehow)
                and created the following graph on scale.
