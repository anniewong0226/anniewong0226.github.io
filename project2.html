        <h2>Project Background: Understanding the Renewable Energy Paradox</h2>
        <p>Europe has pursued aggressive renewable energy policy to incentivise the energy transition to combat climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. The conventional wisdom goes: more renewable generation should lead to lower electricity prices due to near-zero marginal costs of renewable power. However, the reality is oftent more nuanced than a plainly straightfoward relationship. This project investigates: <strong>How does increasing renewable penetration affect electricity prices across European markets?</strong></p>
        <p>By analyzing hourly price and carbon-free generation data from 20 European countries, this project explores both price effects of renewables and the emerging challenges they pose to Europe's electricity system, including increased price volatility, negative pricing events, and intraday fluctuations.</p>

        <h2>Growing Renewable Penetration in Europe</h2>
        <p>Europe has undergone a dramatic energy transformation over the past three decades. Renewable sources have grown from just 35% of electricity generation in 1990 to over 60% in 2024. This chart shows the steady acceleration of this transition, with particularly rapid growth since 2010 driven by ambitious climate policies and falling costs for wind and solar technologies.</p>
        <p>With such a fundamental shift in place, the trend raises critical questions: As the electricity system becomes increasingly dependent on intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar, how do wholesale electricity prices respond?</p>

        <h2>Higher Carbon-Free Generation Reduces Prices</h2>
        <p> I quantify the overall price effect of carbon-free generation by aggregating to the country level. This regression analysis uses data from 20 European countries, comparing each country's average carbon-free percentage against average electricity prices over 2023-2024.</p>
        <p>The results are clear and statistically significant (p < 0.001): <strong>each percentage point increase in carbon-free generation is associated with a €0.82 decrease in average electricity prices.</strong> The model's R² of 0.592 suggest that carbon-free penetration explains approximately 59% of the variation in country-level prices, which supports the hypothesis that carbon-free generation reduces electricity prices.</p>
        <p>Countries like Norway, Finland and Sweden, which generate nearly 100% carbon-free electricity enjoy average prices around €40-50/MWh. In contrast, countries with only 50-60% carbon-free generation, such as Poland and Greece, face prices over €100/MWh. The regression constant of €146.63 represents the theoretical price with zero carbon-free generation. This represent the substantial price premium of fossil fuel-dependent systems.</p>
        <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> I merged hourly price data from Ember with hourly carbon-free generation data from Electricity Maps, creating country-level aggregations from 2023-2024. Each country's average price and average carbon-free percentage between 2023 and 2024 were calculated, then subjected to ordinary least squares regression.</p>

        <h2>The Merit Order Effect in Action: High Carbon-Free Generation, Low Price</h2>
        <p>This chart reveals the mechanism through which carbon-free generation influence electricity prices on an hourly basis throughout 2024. During hours when carbon-free sources meet 70-80% of demand, average prices drop to €60-70/MWh. Conversely, when carbon-free generation falls below 70%, prices spike to €120-130/MWh as expensive fossil fuel plants must be activated.</p>
        <p>This demonstrates the merit order effect in action. In electricity system, the system operator dispatch generation to meet supply based on these the price of offers: the cheapest energy source will be dispatched first. During hours of abundant clean power, renewable generators with near-zero marginal costs are dispatched first, pushing higher-cost coal and gas plants out of the generation mix. When renewables are scarce, expensive thermal plants set the market price.</p>

        <h2>Intraday Electricity Price Fluctuation has Increased in the Past Decade</h2>
        <p>The intraday electricity price swing we see in 2024 is phenomenon only arising in the post-renewable era. This chart tracks average hourly prices from 2015 to 2024. </p>
        <p>Before 2021, prices remained relatively stable throughout the day. Since 2021, a pronounced "duck curve" has emerged: prices plummet during midday hours (12:00-15:00) when solar generation peaks, then surge during evening hours (18:00-20:00) as solar generation drops but demand remains high. This forces grid operators to rapidly ramp up gas and coal plants, creating price spikes that can exceed €100/MWh.</p>
        <p>The year 2022 stands out with exceptionally high prices (averaging over €280/MWh during peak hours), driven by the energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By 2023-2024, prices moderated but the duck curve pattern persists. The widening gap between midday troughs and evening peaks signals growing need for energy storage and flexible capacity.</p>

        <h2>Negative Electricity Pricing has Risen in Europe</h2>
        <p>Negative electricity prices occur when markets signal that the cost of additional electricity generation will be greater than its benefit on the system. For example, when renewable generation surges beyond what the grid can absorb, generators pay grid operators to take their electricity, or reduce output. </p>
        <p>This interactive map shows the frequency of negative pricing hours across Europe has increased and become more widespread. Germany, Spain and Netherland are among the worst hit nations, which experienced over 400 such hours. These countries, while has high solar penetration and limited energy storage or interconnection capacity to export surplus generation.</p>
        <p>Noticeably, Nordic countries are diverging in the frequency of negative pricing. Finland and Sweden show higher negative pricing rate, while its neighbour, Norway has no negative pricing at all during 2024. Norway's fleet of flexible hydro system, which could store excess energy and can be deployed rapidly when other renewables are falling, shields the country from the fluctuation Sweden and Finland experience. For example for Finland, the rapid buildout of intermittent renewables and the phase-in of Olkiluoto 3, which is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe at 1.6 GW, created highly inflexible capacity. </p>
        <p>Frequent occurrences of negative pricing threaten the economic viability of all generators and impact the investment signal for renewable.  There is therefore an urgent need for grid flexibility solutions, such as battery storage, demand response, and stronger interconnections.</p>

        <h2>Not All Countries Experience the Same Transition</h2>
        <p>While the aggregate relationship between renewables and prices is clear, not all European countries experience the energy transition identically. This clustering analysis groups countries based on eight dimensions: average price, price volatility, carbon-free percentage, carbon-free volatility, renewable percentage, negative pricing frequency, and price variability metrics.</p>
        <p><strong>Cluster 0 (High Price, Moderate Clean):</strong> Countries like the UK, Italy, Poland, Greece, and Ireland face high average prices (€100/MWh) under moderate renewable penetration (43%). These are typically island or peripheral markets with limited interconnection capacity and reliance on imported fossil fuels. They experience relatively few negative pricing events (0.67%) due to the limited intermittent renewables. It has to be noted that some countries like Italy has installed the minimum price floor which prevents the price from going below negative, which could impact the negative pricing data</p>
        <p><strong>Cluster 1 (Low Price, Very High Clean):</strong> Finland and Sweden stand out with exceptionally low prices (€47/MWh) and nearly 97% carbon-free generation, dominated by baseload renewables such as hydropower. Their extensive hydro storage allows them to handle intermittent renewables effectively.</p>
        <p><strong>Cluster 2 (Mid-Market with Volatility):</strong> This group includes Germany, Spain, France, and other central European countries with strong renewable growth but significant challenges managing intermittency. They show moderate prices (€70-80/MWh) with high volatility as they navigate the transition without Nordic-style hydro flexibility.</p>
        <p>This heterogeneity reveals that success in the energy transition in Europe depends not just on renewable capacity. Improving interconnection between these countries could bridge the gap for absorbing the excess renewable generation </p>
        <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Principal Component Analysis reduced eight variables to four dimensions explaining 95.75% of variance, followed by K-means clustering to identify 3 groupings of countries with similar energy market characteristics using the Elbow Method</p>

        <h2>Conclusions: Cheaper, But Flexibility Matters</h2>
        <p>These graphs support that increased renewable penetration reduces average electricity prices through the merit order effect: by crowding out expensive fossil fuel generation which thus lower market prices.
            Countries with high carbon-free generation enjoy significantly lower wholesale prices, with each percentage point of carbon-free generation reducing prices by approximately €0.82/MWh.</p>
        <p>However, this price benefit comes with new challenges. The energy transition is generating unprecedented price volatility. The emergence of "duck curve" patterns is worrying for the system: midday solar abundance crashes prices while evening demand spikes them due to expensive fossil fuel ramp up. This phenomenon prevents true decarbonisation and poses systemic risk. 
            Further, negative pricing events, which was once rare, now occur regularly in markets with high renewable penetration, signaling grid inflexibility and the urgent need for energy storage solutions.</p>

        <p>The clustering analysis reveals that Europe could benefit immensely if there are more inter-country interconnection to export excess renewable energy. Countries with flexible hydro resources navigate high renewable penetration successfully with low, stable prices. Others face persistent high prices despite high renewable penetration. When these countries build more interconnection, surplus supply can be exported to markets for deeper decarbonisation and cheaper energy.</p>

        <h3>Policy Implications</h3>
        <p>Europe has to abandon the mindless hunt for renewable capacity without thinking about its burden to the system. For the next decade, the path to cheaper and cleaner electricity requires more than just building more wind and solar farms. Viable policies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Energy storage deployment: </strong> Storage is able to smooth intraday price fluctuations and shift renewable generation to hours that are most valuable for grid stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Grid interconnection expansion: </strong> Countries with more flexible renewable resources can export surplus renewable energy to serve demand in another.</li>
            <li><strong>Market design reforms: </strong> Right now, the market has no mechanism to reflect the value of storage. Market design that properly value flexibility can ensure adequate investment in more battery storage. </li>
            <li><strong>Demand-side flexibility: </strong> Countries experiencing duck curve should consider smart meters and time-of-use pricing to allow more demand-side response to price signals</li>
        </ul>
